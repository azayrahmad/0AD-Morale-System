# 0 AD Morale System
This is a simple mod to simulate morale in 0 A.D. units, inspired from a mix between Total War and Stronghold style morale. So basically the higher the morale, the better your units at gathering, building, and fighting, and vice versa. Morale is influenced by unit's health, being attacked, being near other units, etc. On a very low morale, units will flee the battlefield and player lost control of said units.
